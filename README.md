# My R style guide

This style guide outlines how I like to code in [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org). I try to maintain R code etiquette based on the general R community's style. Like any style, it's evolving.

**File naming:** Use the `.R` file extension, not lower case `.r`. When a file name is composed of multiple words, they should be seprated by underscores. I avoid hyphens. Names should be descriptive, but there's no need to be too strict. Just *use good judgement*. Examples: `fold_rna.R`, `getGeneExpression.R`, `detect.svm.R`.

**Variable names:** I like to use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).
